Lua Tools
============

A collection of various scripting tools I have built and used frequently
over the years.

While the repo is named "Lua", these scripts should be run with
[torch7](https://github.com/torch/torch7). Torch injects a lot of
useful globals, like the entire penlight library.

Additionally, each script may require its own dependencies.
Use luarocks as needed ;)
